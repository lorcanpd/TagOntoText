TagOntoText is a project to develop a tool for the unsupervised training of constructors that make machine-readable semantic representations of text. Specifically, it will take an input of an OWL format ontology and a corpus of sentences, and output a constructor that can parse the unstructured text of a publication, and generate a graph representation of the concepts it contains.
