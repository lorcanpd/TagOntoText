# TagOntoText

TagOntoText is a project to develop a tool that generates domain-ontology specific training data for NLP. Specifically, it will take an input of an xml-format OWL ontology and a corpus of unstructured text, and output a labelled dataset for training named entity recognition or relation extraction models.
